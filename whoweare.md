## Who we are

We are a group of developers that entered Facebook Developer Circles and Andela's challenge called *[Build for Sustainable Development Goals](https://buildforsdg.andela.com/)* or #BuildForSDG for short. For the innovation phase, we were grouped together as Team-199 and come up with a solution to address social issues.
