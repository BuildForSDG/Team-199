# Front-End Team-199 / Where You Are (WYR)
Bringing services to you, even if you don't have a formal address.

# About Us
We are a group of developers that entered Facebook Developer Circles and Andela’s challenge called Build for Sustainable Development Goals or #BuildForSDG for short. For the innovation phase, we were grouped together as Team-199 and came up with a solution to address social issues.

# Why
So many Africans do not live in formal housing and therefore also don’t have a formal address.
This excludes them from simple services such as getting items delivered to their door, to critical services if they need to be found by emergency services. 
Therefore WYR seeks to solve such a problem in a very simple way using what3words.

# Usage
This is a web application that can be accessed by everyone inneed of the emergency services. It has got three web pages namely
* Home
* Contact Us
* About Us

When a user navigates to the home page, he can be able to select which services they may need. The Emergency services are comprised of three categories;

* Police
* Fire-rescue
* Paramedics

So ideally when a user or client clicks on the report emergency button, it takes them to the exact location they are at for them to get help.

# SetUp
Install npm or yarn if you dont have any of them already installed. We recommend Yarn though.

After clonning the repo to your local machine and moving into the cloned folder, Run yarn install to get started by installing dependencies.

src/index.js is the entry to the project and source code should go into the src folder.

All tests should be written in the `tests' folder. There's a sample in there.

This starter uses Parcel as the bundler. It is much simpler that WebPack and the others

# Hints
* Run npm install or yarn install to get started. We'll assume you are using Yarn.
* Install additional dependencies: yarn add <dependency-name> [-D]
* Run tests: yarn test
* Run tests with test coverage info: yarn test:cover
* Check the codebase for proper syntax and formatting compliance: yarn lint
* Run your app in local dev mode: yarn start. This puts the bundled app in a dist folder, set up a local web server at localhost:1234, and continues to watch for your code changes which it syncs with the local server. This means if you loaded the app in a browser, it will auto-refresh as you code along. Feel free to use whatever bundler best meets your needs. Parcel was only added as a sample and for those looking for a simple but effective solution to the hassle of bundlers.

# Contributing
If this project sounds interesting to you and you'd like to contribute, thank you! First, you can send a mail to buildforsdg@andela.com to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :

area one (e.g this app is about human trafficking and you need feedback on your roadmap and feature list from the private sector / NGOs)
area two (e.g you want people to opt-in and try using your staging app at staging.project-name.com and report any bugs via a form)
area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)

# Acknowledgements
